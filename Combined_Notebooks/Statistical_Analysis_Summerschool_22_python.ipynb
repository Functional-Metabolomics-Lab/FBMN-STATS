    "# **About the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The files used in this tutorial are part of an interlab comparison study, where different laboratories around the world analysed the same environmental samples on their respective LC-MS/MS equipments. To simulate algal bloom, standardized algae extracts (A) in marine dissovled organic matter (M) at different concentrations were prepared (450 (A45M); 150 (A15M); and 50 (A5M) ppm A). Samples were then shipped to different laboratories for untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis. The data used particularly for this notebook is from Lab 1 (Dorrestein Lab, University of California at San Diego, USA; Data submitted by Allegra Aron allegra.aron@gmail.com ) <br><br>\n",
    "(*To be edited*) In this tutorial, we are working with one of the datasets, which was acquired on a UHPLC system coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF Orbitrap LC-MS/MS mass spectrometer. MS/MS data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) with fragmentation of the five most abundant ions in the spectrum per precursor scan. Data files were subsequently preprocessed using [MZmine3](http://mzmine.github.io/) and the [feature-based molecular networking workflow in GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=d207c3a831264d61810ad69ac09b14e9)."

    "# **About the different sections in the Notebook:**\n",
    "### **1. Data-cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves cleaning the feature table, which contains all the features (metabolites, in our case) with their corresponding intensities. The data cleanup steps involved are: 1) Blank removal 2) Imputation 3) Normalisation. Each step would be discussed in detail later. Once the data is cleaned, we can then use it for further statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Univariate statistical analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use univariate statistical methods, such as ANOVA, to investigate whether there are differences in the levels of individual features between different time points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Unsupervised multivariate analyses:**\n",
    "#### **i. PCoA and PERMANOVA**\n",
    "Here, we will perform a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), also known as metric or classical Multidimensional Scaling (metric MDS) to explore and visualize patterns in an untargeted mass spectromtery-based metabolomics dataset. We will then assess statistical significance of the patterns and dispersion of different sample types using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ii. Cluster Analyses and Heatmaps**\n",
    "We will also perform different cluster analyses to explore patterns in the data. This will help us to discover subgroups of samples or features that share a certain level of similarity. Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning where no labels are given to the learning algorithm which will try to find patterns/structures in the input data on its own. The goal of clustering is to find these hidden patterns.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some types of cluster analyses (e.g. hierarchical clustering) are often associated with heatmaps. Heatmaps are a visual representation of the data where columns are usually samples and rows are features (in our case, different metabolic features). The color scale of heatmaps indicates higher or lower intensity (for instance, blue is lower and red is higher intensity).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of good videos and resources out there explaining very well the principle behind clustering. Some good ones are the following:<br>\n",
    "- Hierarchical clustering and heatmaps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHsRkOdVwo<br>\n",

    "# Step1: Blank Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> In LC-MS/MS, we use solvents called Blanks which are usually injected time-to-time to prevent carryover of the sample. The features coming from these Blanks would also be detected by LC-MS/MS instrument. Our goal here is to remove these features from our samples. The other blanks that can be removed are: Signals coming from growth media alone in terms of microbial growth experiment, signals from the solvent used for extraction methods and so on. Therefore, it is best practice to measure mass spectra of these blanks as well in addition to your sample spectra. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we remove these blank features?** </br> \n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Since we have the feature table split into Control blanks and Sample groups now, we can compare blanks to the sample to identify the background features coming from blanks. A common filtering method is to use a cutoff to remove features that are not present sufficient enough in our biological samples. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps followed in the next few cells are:\n",
    "1. <p style='text-align: justify;'> We find an average for all the feature intensities in your blank set and sample set. Therefore, for n no.of features in a blank or sample set, we get n no.of averaged features. </p>\n",
    "2. <p style='text-align: justify;'> Next, we get a ratio of this average_blanks vs average_sample. This ratio Blank/sample tells us how much of that particular feature of a sample gets its contribution from blanks. If it is more than 30% (or Cutoff as 0.3), we consider the feature as noise. </p>\n",
    "3. <p style='text-align: justify;'> The resultant information (if ratio > Cutoff or not) is stored in a bin such as 1 = Noise or background signal, 0 = Feature Signal</p>\n",
    "4. <p style='text-align: justify;'> We count the no.of features in the bin that satisfies the condition ratio > cutoff, and consider those features as 'noise or background features' and remove them. </p>"

    "Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) is a metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) method that attempts to represent sample dissimilarities in a low-dimensional space. It converts a distance matrix consisting of pair-wise distances (dissimilarities) across samples into a 2- or 3-D graph (Gower, 2005). Different distance metrics can be used to calculate dissimilarities among samples (e.g. Euclidean, Canberra, Minkowski). Performing a principal coordinates analysis using the Euclidean distance metric is the same as performing a principal components analysis (PCA). The selection of the most appropriate metric depends on the nature of your data and assumptions made by the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the metabolomics field the Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, Jaccard or Canberra distances are most commonly used. The Jaccard distance is an unweighted metric (presence/absence) whereas Euclidean, Bray-Curtis and Canberra distances take into account relative abundances (weighted). Some metrics may be better suited for very sparse data (with many zeroes) than others. For example, the Euclidean distance metric is not recommended to be used for highly sparse data.\n",
